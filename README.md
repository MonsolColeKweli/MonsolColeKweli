- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <b>@MonsolColeKweli</b>
- I have many interest in Software Engineering, robotics, cybersecurity, and pretty much anything dealing with tech and programming. 
- Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Miami University with an
- intermediate level experience in programs such as Java, Python, C++, and Matlab.
- Though I am always looking to expand my skillset and learn more about things outside my
- comfort zones. Please take a look at my repositories to see the work i've done thus far, also please look out for
- updates as I'll continue to post new projects that come my way!
