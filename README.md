- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MonsolColeKweli
- Iâ€™m interested in robotics, cybersecurity, and pretty much anything dealing with Electronics. 
- Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Miami University with
- intermediate level experience in programs such as java, python, and matlab.
- Though I am always looking to expand my skillset and learn more about things outside my
- comfort zones. Please take a look at my repositories to see the work i've done thus far, also look out for
- updates as I'll continue to post new projects that come my way!
